# One Page Zine

Requires:
- Python3
- selenium (pip3 install selenium)
- chromedriver
  
Download the chromedriver from here:
[Google chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home)
and unzip it in the git directory.

## To Run
Open terminal and run
'''
python3 selenium_get_img.py [your zine topic]
'''

I use chrome to print these, if you go to:

file:///*your/path/to/git/repo*/1PGZ/1PGZ.html

it's formatted to print, so you can just hit Ctrl+p and print the page!
